        <h1>Caught by the attack</h1>
        <h2>
            As you evaded to the side, the giant rock golem caught you with its arm, crashing against the wall. <br>
            It then proceeded to stand up, with you in its hands. You felt the grip tightened along your ribs, gradually <br>
            crushing you until your spine snapped. In an instant, you then exploded into a pool of blood as it crushed <br>
            your entirety in the golem's extremely tight grip.
        </h2>

        <br>
        <p>Quite the unfortunate turn of events. May no traveler ever attempt to venture this dungeon again.</p>
