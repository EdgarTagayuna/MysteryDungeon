        <h1>Final Gambit</h1>
        <h2>
            As you rushed through with great speed, you jumped and striked the core with your sword. The blade pierced through <br>
            the crimson core, causing it to crack even more until it shattered. When the core shattered, so did the giant rock golem. <br>
            You avoid the falling debri from its body. Further ahead, you noticed a door opening up. What will you do now, traveler? <br>
        </h2>

        <a href="TypeC5_Maze.html">Try to climb your way out of this ditch, and go back to the previous floor. Where you will traverse the hallway once more.</a> <!--2-->
