            Traversing the pathway, it seemed to strech endlessly towards a very dark, singular point. <br>
            As you continued on foot, all you could hear was your footsteps <br>
            and the sound of your beating heart. Upon finally reaching another conjuction point, you are then greeted by yet <br>
            another set of choices to make. A pathway going straight, to the left, and to the right. This time, you hear odd noises from all paths. <br>
            So much so that it triggered a bit of your fight or flight response. What will you do now, traveler?
