        <h1>You were too late...</h1>
        <h2>
            As you rushed through with great speed, and jumped to make contact with the core with your sword, <br>
            in an instant, the golem's core glowed yet again. You realized it was pretending to be incapacitated. <br>
            No...Rather, perhaps it recovered from the damages it sustained due to hitting the walls multiple times, and that <br>
            you were a bit late. Time slowed down as the a giant fist was coming straight at you. Before reaching the core, <br>
            the fist made contact, hitting you with great force, and causing you to be launched to the ground into a bloody pulp. 
        </h2>

        <br>
        <p>Quite the unfortunate turn of events. You were close. May other travelers never enter this dungeon ever again.</p>
