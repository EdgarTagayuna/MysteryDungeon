        <h1>Eternal Darkness</h1>

        <h2>
            As you looked around, your surroundings became darker and darker. Everything got cold. You felt yourself losing conciousness. <br>
            With your body feeling a lot heavier than usual, you fell down to the ground. From the corners of your eyes, you noticed someone. <br>
            It was the girl from before. You saw her smirking with her eyes nowhere to be seen. With your eyes getting heavier and heavier, you fell <br>
            into an eternal slumber.
        </h2>

        <br>
        <p>May you slumber in peace, young soul.</p>
