        <h1>Thorns</h1>
        <h2>
            Traversing the pathway, it seemed to strech endlessly towards a very dark, singular point. <br>
            As you continued on foot, all you could hear was your footsteps and the sound of your heart beating. <br>
            Just as you were walking, the ground suddenly crumbled and gave away, resulting in you falling down from a pretty high place. <br>
            In an instance, everything was becoming a blur. At that moment, you realized that huge thorns portruding from the ground <br>
            pierced through your body. You coughed up blood, with your vision becoming even blurrier. In the end, you lost consciousness, <br>
            and died.
            
        </h2>

        <br>
        <p>You shouldn't have entered in the first place. May this be a lesson to future travelers.</p>
