        <p>Welcome, traveler. Perhaps you do not realize the dangers venturing this dungeon awaits.</p>
        <p>The challenges when entering this mystery dungeon led to the demise of other young souls such as yourself.</p>
        <p>Many vengeful spirits, monsters, beasts, and demonic foes will stand in your way from reaching the end.</p>
        <p>I would suggest you turn back now for your own good.</p>
        <p>But if you truly wish to venture on, state what you seek from this dungeon, and proceed with caution.</p>
        <p>May the heavens bless your travels, young soul.</p>
