        <h1>Feast upon the flesh</h1>

        <h2>
            As you you jumped once more, the ground suddenly crumbled and gave away, resulting in you falling down from a pretty high place. <br>
            From the fall, you couldn't move properly. You broke you left leg, and damaged both of your ribs. When you tried to stand up, you realized you were surrounded by zombies. <br>
            In an instance, the horde of zombies rushed towards you like rabid animals seeing food for the first time, <br>
            tearing through your flesh and bones, gnawing every piece of you until there was nothing left.
        </h2>

        <br>
        <p>How unfortunate. I've warned you didn't I? You shouldn't have entered in the first place.</p>
