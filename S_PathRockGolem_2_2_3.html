        <h2>
            As you evaded up, jumping with all your might, the golem crashed on a wall behind you. You managed to climb on top of it. <br>
            The golem proceeds to lift both of its giant hands, but for some reason, it stopped moving. Both of its arms fell to the ground. <br>
            What will you do now, traveler?
