        <h1>Evading the charge attack</h1>
        <h2>
            As you evaded to the side, the giant rock golem ended up crashing towards the wall, creating a sort of rumbling in <br>
            the general area. It stopped moving for some reason. When you looked around it, you noticed that the core was no longer <br>
            glowing. You stood and waited, and noticed that the it glowed back up again. The giant proceeded to position itself like previously. <br>
            Only this time, the giant extended its right arm. What will you do now, traveler?
