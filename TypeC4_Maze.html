        <h1>Walls</h1>
        <h2>
            Traversing the pathway, it seemed to strech endlessly towards a very dark, singular point. <br>
            As you continued on foot, all you could hear was your footsteps and the sound of your heart beating. <br>
            Just as you were walking, in an instant, both sides of the walls compressed your entirety, causing <br>
            you to be splattered into a bloody pulp.
            
        </h2>

        <br>
        <p>You shouldn't have been so careless. May this be a lesson for you.</p>
