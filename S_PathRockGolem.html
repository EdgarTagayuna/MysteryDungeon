        <h1>Monster Encounter: Giant Rock Golem</h1>
        <h2>
            As you walked towards the hallway, the walls and the floor further in front of you suddenly crumbled. <br>
            You saw a giant, rock-like hand coming out of the crumbling wall. Then its entirety showed up, causing the <br>
            surrounding area to give away. You fell, and so was the giant. Upon landing, you noticed a 20ft tall rock golem <br>
            towering in front of you. Its body structure was similar to that of a human's. The only difference was that <br>
            it had no face, and its entire body was made out of rock or stone of some kind. At the center of its body, there was a <br>
            crimson core glowing brightly. The golem proceeded to lower itself on all fours with its knees supporting it, giving it a total of <br>
            12ft height distribution. It seemed like it was about to charge in like a bull. You looked around, but there didn't seem to be a way out. As it charged <br>
            towards you, the giant golem was heading in a linear movement. It didn't seem like it could turn very quickly either. <br>
            What will you do, traveler?
