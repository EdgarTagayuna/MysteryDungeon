        <h2>
            When you continued forward, the footsteps were getting closer and closer. You looked behind, there was nothing there. <br>
            However, the hissing sounds were getting louder and louder. You looked behind once more, mist started forming from where you were. It was cold.<br>
            As you exhaled, you could see your breath forming. The torches from the wall were put out one by one. It was as if <br>
            darkness itself was slowly creeping in. Amidst the darkness from afar, you saw a girl with skin pale as paper. <br>
            Clad in a white robe with her long, black hair, covering her face, you felt a sense of terror. Barefooted, she took a step, causing the flames of <br>
            of the torches to be put out. The mist followed her, as the hissing got louder and louder. What will you do now, traveler?
