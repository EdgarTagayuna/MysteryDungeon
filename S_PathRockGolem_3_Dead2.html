        <h1>Dead End</h1>
        <h2>
            As you attempted to jump back up towards the floor above, you were able to grab the ledge. However, you realized that it was a feint. <br>
            It stood up, and extended its very lengthy arms. It managed to grab hold of you, crushing your parts of your ribs. It proceeded to <br>
            throw you to the ground, breaking various parts of your body. To your surprise, you were still alive. However, from your peripheral vision, <br>
            you see the giant walking slowly towards you. You tried moving, but you couldn't. The ground shook each step, until you realized its giant feet was <br>
            next to you. In an instant, everything was dark as the giant rock golem stepped on you repeatedly, resulting in a puddle of blood.

        <p>Quite the unfortunate turn of events.</p>
