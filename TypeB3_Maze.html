        <h2>
            You decided to go back once more. As you continued on foot, all you could hear was your footsteps and the sound of your beating heart.<br>
            Upon finally reaching another conjuction point, you are then greeted by yet another set of choices to make.<br>
            A pathway going straight, to the left, and to the right. This time, you were surprised.<br>
            It seemed like you are back to where you were just now, yet again. <br>
            All three paths were still dangerous and ominous sounding than ever. <br>
            So much so that it triggered a bit of your fight or flight response. <br>
            It seems though going back isn't really much of an option. What will you do now, traveler?
