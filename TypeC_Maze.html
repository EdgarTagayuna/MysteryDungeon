            Traversing the pathway, it seemed to strech endlessly towards a very dark, singular point. <br>
            As you continued on foot, all you could hear was your footsteps and the sound of your heart beating. <br>
            Upon reaching this bright, dome-like room, you are presented a multitude of paths. In the middle of the room, <br>
            a stone tablet stood. It mentions that many of the paths will be treacherous. Proceed with caution.<br>
            What will you do now, traveler?
