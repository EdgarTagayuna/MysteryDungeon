        <h2>
            Traversing the pathway, you hear your own footsteps echoing through the hallway. It seemed to strech endlessly towards a very dark, singular point. <br>
            Looking back from where you came, it almost look exactly the same, just like a mirror. As you continued on foot, you hear odd noises.<br>
            It got cold all of a sudden, sending chills down your spine. It was almost as if someone...or something is following you. You look back again, <br>
            and there was nothing there. The steps sounded unnatural. Something completely different from that of a human's. <br>
            Whenever you took a step, so did the one following you. Upon finally reaching another conjuction point, you are then greeted by yet <br>
            another set of choices to make. A pathway going straight, to the left, and to the right. This time, you hear odd noises from the right. <br>
            So much so that it triggered a bit of your fight or flight response. What will you do now, traveler?
